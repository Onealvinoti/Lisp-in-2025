# Lisp in 2025: A Practical Guide to the One True Programming Language

A comprehensive, modern guide to the Lisp family of programming languages, covering everything from historical context to cutting-edge applications in 2025.

## About This Book

This book is for programmers who want to understand and use Lisp in 2025. Whether you're curious about why Lisp has endured for nearly 70 years, want to learn functional programming, or need to build robust systems with minimal complexity, this book will guide you through the diverse and powerful world of Lisp.

## What You'll Learn

- **The Power of Homoiconicity**: Understand why "code as data" is more than just a clever trick
- **Multiple Lisp Dialects**: Master Common Lisp, Scheme, Clojure, ClojureScript, and Emacs Lisp
- **Practical Development**: Set up modern development environments and build real applications
- **Advanced Techniques**: Macros, DSLs, concurrent programming, and metaprogramming
- **Real-World Applications**: Web services, data processing, browser applications, and more

## Who This Book Is For

- **Curious Programmers**: You've heard about Lisp and want to understand what makes it special
- **Functional Programming Enthusiasts**: You want to learn FP from the source
- **Professional Developers**: You need powerful abstractions for complex problems
- **Language Designers**: You want to understand language design fundamentals
- **Students**: You're learning computer science and want deep understanding

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming experience in any language
- Comfort with command-line tools
- Curiosity about different ways of thinking about code
- No prior Lisp experience required!

## How to Read This Book

- **Sequential Path**: Read chapters 1-10 in order for a complete journey
- **Dialect-Specific**: Jump to chapters 3-7 for specific Lisp dialects
- **Practical Focus**: Start with chapter 8 for environment setup, then explore projects in chapter 9
- **Quick Start**: Read chapters 1, 6, and 8 to get started with modern Clojure development

## Code Examples

All code examples in this book are tested and working as of 2025. Each example includes:
- Clear explanations of concepts
- Runnable code you can experiment with
- Real-world applications, not just toy examples

## Setting Up Your Environment

Quick start for each dialect:

```bash
# Common Lisp
brew install sbcl
curl -O https://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp
sbcl --load quicklisp.lisp

# Clojure
brew install clojure/tools/clojure

# Scheme (Racket)
brew install --cask racket

# Emacs (for Emacs Lisp)
brew install --cask emacs
```

## About the Author

This book was written by someone who believes that Lisp is not just a programming language but a notation for expressing thought, and that parentheses are not obstacles but wings that let your code fly.
